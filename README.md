Project Module 2 for Ironhack Data Analysis Bootcamp


- Given dataset of Diamond with the following features,
        . Carat
        . Cut
        . Color
        . Clarity
        . Depth
        . Table
        . Price
        . x
        . y
        . z

- The first thing to do, is a exploring and cleaning the source dataset
- The idea is to do an individual analysis about each feature in contrast of price. 
- We are going to analyze and visualize the distribution of categorical and numerical features.
- We are going to check if there are any correlation between any feature and the price.

- The library we are going to use in this snalysis are the following,
        . Pandas
        . Matplotlib
        . Seaborn
        . Cufflinks
        . Plotly Express
        
- The second part of this study is to do a tool to estimate price a part from the features of a diamond.
